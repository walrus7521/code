# Sample input:

# First line has two integers N, denoting the number of nodes 
# in the graph and M, denoting the number of edges in the graph.
# The next M lines each consist of three space separated integers 
# x y r, where x and y denote the two nodes between which the 
# undirected edge exists, r denotes the weight of edge between 
# the corresponding nodes.

# 4 6
# 1 2 5
# 1 3 3
# 4 1 6
# 2 4 7
# 3 2 4
# 3 4 5

# Sample output: 12
