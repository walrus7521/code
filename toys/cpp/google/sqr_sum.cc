/*
 * Exercise 1
 * The integer 36 has a peculiar property: it is a perfect square, and is 
 * also the sum of the integers from 1 through 8. The next such number is 
 * 1225 which is 352, and the sum of the integers from 1 through 49. Find 
 * the next number that is a perfect square and also the sum of a series 
 * 1...n. This next number may be greater than 32767. You may use library 
 * functions that you know of, (or mathematical formulas) to make your 
 * program run faster. It is also possible to write this program using 
 * for-loops to determine if a number is a perfect square or a sum of a 
 * series. (Note: depending on your machine and your program, it can take 
 * quite a while to find this number.)
