Add graph directionality to input file?


DFS - undirected, unweighted
    connected components undirected graph
    floodfill label individual components in forest
    articulation points and bridges
    strongly connected - tarjan - directed graph
    topological sort in DAG

Kruskal - weighted, undirected
    MST - Greedy

BFS
    SSSP - unweighted undirected graph
         note: if weighted, path length is sum of wts on short path

Dijkstra - Greedy
    SSSP - weighted directed graph

Bellman-Ford - DP
    SSSP - negative weights directed graph
    Negative Cycle Check

Floyd-Warshall - DP (small directed (+/-) weighted graph)
    APSP - all pairs shortest path
    Transitive closure - check if any 2 verts are directly OR indirectly connected

Edmonds-Karp - directed weighted positive capacity edges
    Max flow
