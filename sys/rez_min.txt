Helitrak, Inc, Software Engr                            Dec 2015 to Present
    Helicopter autopilot embedded ARM firmware, device drivers, inertial 
    sensors, servo control/calibration, flight test instrumentation and 
    post-flight video/audio processing using OpenCV and DirectX. Ported
    control law algorithms from Matlab/Simulink.

OSNexus, Inc, Software Engr                             Jul 2015 to Dec 2015
    Software defined cloud-storage - Linux kernel device driver development, 
    developed SCST/FC & iSCSI load-balance path and high-availability node 
    failover code, and developed mapper-based driver to evaluate perf of 
    CEPH/RBDs and crush map zone distribution.

Western Digital, Sr. Principal SDE, Lead                Aug 2012 to Jul 2015
    Developed Linux kernel framework for plugging multiple storage transports: 
    NVMe, AHCI/SATAe, SOP/PQI for FPGA and ASIC bring-up, device and firmware 
    virtualization. Framework allowed kernel execution of compiled scripts. 
    Also, developed device mapper layer for SATAe hybrid SSD/HDD drive.

    used were Storport/Scsiport miniports, full port drivers, various storage 
    filter drivers based off of WDM or KMDF, 3rd party volume managers, full 
    file system drivers, file system mini-filters based off of Filter Manager, 
    network redirectors, and network Lightweight Filters.  Debugged many internal 
    OS components, filed bugs, and in many cases provided fixes.  Developed various 
    code samples for external publication on OneCode.
